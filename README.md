Note: This program uses the JavaFX library, make sure it is downloaded and linked to your IDE properly for the program to function. 

This is a JavaFX game, which is drawn to and played on a new window on the screen, that is my graphical rendition of the game Wumpus World. 

How the game works:
- The player must venture into a dark cave to find treasure. He takes with him a bow and a single arrow.
- In the cave there are pits that will kill the player if he/she were to fall into them. Although the player will not be able to see the pits, due to the cave being dark, he will feel a breeze when he is near a pit.
- In addition to the pits, there is a wumpus in the cave. A wumpus is a smelly monster that will eat the player when he/she stumbles into it. The player will know he/she is near a wumpus due to its stench.
- The player may only fire his arrow one time. If the arrow hits the wumpus it will die and the player will hear a scream.
- The player will only be able to see squares he/she is on or has been to in the past. To win the game the player must navigate the cave, retrieve the treasure and then climb up the ladder.
